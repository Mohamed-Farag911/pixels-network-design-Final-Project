# pixels-network-design-Final-Project


This is my final project for the **Mini-Course by Pixels Egypt** during the mid-year break 2025.  
The objective was to design and configure a functional, secure, and efficient network for multiple committees in Pixels Egypt’s workspace.

## Project Highlights
- **Subnetting** for optimal IP allocation.
- **VLAN Configuration** for segmentation.
- **Dynamic Routing (RIP & OSPF)**.
- **DHCP Setup** for automatic IP assignment.
- **Secure Telnet Access** for remote management.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking Fundamentals
- Routing & Switching Configuration
